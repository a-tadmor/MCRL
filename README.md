# MCRL -  Metagenome Clustering by Reference Library

MCRL (formally MetaCAT) is a heuristic iterative clustering approach applied to a reference library with respect to a given metagenome to obtain all genes in the reference library that have significant hits in the given metagenome and which exhibit homology to different sets of contigs. The input to MCRL is an assembled metagenome that does not need to be annotated, and a reference library containing annotated genes, such as a RefSeq database. Upon installation MCRL assembles the most recent RefSeq database for viruses as a default reference library, however, MCRL can be used with any reference library as well as other taxonomic or logical groups.
For installation instructions see the accompanying README file. For more detailed instructions, a user guide is provided with the source code.
